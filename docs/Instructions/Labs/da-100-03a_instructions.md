### Lab 03A

Loading Data in Power BI Desktop

# Overview

**The estimated time to complete the lab is 45 minutes**

In this lab, you will commence apply transformations to each of the queries created in the previous lab. You will then apply the queries to load each as a table to the data model.

In this lab, you learn how to:

* Apply various transformations

* Apply queries to load them to the data model

# Exercise 1: Load Data

In this exercise, you will apply transformations to each of the queries created in the previous lab.

*If you’re not confident you completed the previous lab successfully, you can open the previous lab’s solution file, which is found in the **D:\DA100\Lab02A\Solution** folder*.

### Task 1: Configure the Salesperson query

In this task, you will configure the **Salesperson** query.

1. In the **Power Query Editor** window, in the **Queries** pane, select the **DimEmployee** query.

    ![Picture 1](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image1.png)

2. To rename the query, in the **Query Settings** pane (located at the right), in the **Name** box, replace the text with **Salesperson**, and then press **Enter**.

    *The query name will determine the model table name. It’s recommended to define concise, yet friendly, names*.

3. In the **Queries** pane, verify that the query name has updated.

    ![Picture 87](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image2.png)

    *You will now filter the query rows to retrieve only employees who are salespeople*.

4. To locate a specific column, on the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Manage Columns** group, click the **Choose Columns** down-arrow, and then select **Go to Column**.

    ![Picture 88](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image3.png)

    *Tip: This technique is useful when a query contains many columns. Usually, you can simply horizontally scroll to locate the column*.

5. In the **Go to Column** window, to order the list by column name, click the **AZ** sort button, and then select **Name**.

    ![Picture 94](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image4.png)

6. Select the **SalesPersonFlag** column, and then click **OK**.

7. To filter the query, in the **SalesPersonFlag** column header, click the down-arrow, and then uncheck **FALSE**.

    ![Picture 95](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image5.png)

8. Click **OK**.

    ![Picture 96](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image6.png)

9. In the **Query Settings** pane, in the **Applied Steps** list, notice the addition of the **Filtered Rows** step.

    ![Picture 98](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image7.png)

    *Each transformation you create results in additional step logic. It’s possible to edit or delete steps. It’s also possible to select a step to preview the query results at that stage of transformation*.

10. To remove columns, on the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Manage Columns** group, click the **Choose Columns** icon.

    ![Picture 99](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image8.png)

11. In the **Choose Columns** window, to uncheck all columns, uncheck the **(Select All Columns)** item.

    * EmployeeKey

    * EmployeeNationalIDAlternateKey

    * FirstName

    * LastName

    * Title

    * EmailAddress

13. Click **OK**.

    ![Picture 104](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image10.png)

14. In the **Applied Steps** list, notice the addition of another query step.

    ![Picture 116](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image12.png)

17. Right-click either of the select column headers, and then in the context menu, select **Merge Columns**.

    ![Picture 117](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image13.png)

    *Many common transformations can be applied by right-clicking the column header, and then choosing them from the context menu. Note, however, that all transformations—and more—are available in the ribbon*.

18. In the **Merge Columns** window, in the **Separator** dropdown list, select **Space**.

19. In the **New Column Name** box, replace the text with **Salesperson**.

    ![Picture 119](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image14.png)

20. Click **OK**.

    ![Picture 5636](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image15.png)

21. To rename the **EmployeeNationalIDAlternateKey** column, double-click the **EmployeeNationalIDAlternateKey** column header.

22. Replace the text with **EmployeeID**, and then press **Enter**.

    *When instructed to rename columns, it’s important that you rename them exactly as described*.

23. Use the previous steps to rename the **EmailAddress** column to **UPN**.

    *UPN is an acronym for User Principal Name. The values in this column will be used when you configure row-level security in **Lab 05A***.

24. At the bottom-left, in the status bar, verify that the query has five columns and 18 rows.

    ![Picture 5638](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image16.png)

    *It’s important that you do not proceed if your query does not produce the correct result—it won’t be possible to complete later labs. If it doesn’t, refer back to the steps in this task to fix any problems*.

### Task 2: Configure the SalespersonRegion query

In this task, you will configure the **SalespersonRegion** query.

1. In the **Queries** pane, select the **DimEmployeeSalesTerritory** query.

    ![Picture 5639](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image17.png)

26. In the **Query Settings** pane, rename the query to **SalespersonRegion**.

27. To remove the last two columns, first select the **DimEmployee** column header.

    ![Picture 5641](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image19.png)

### Task 3: Configure the Product query

In this task, you will configure the **Product** query.

*When detailed instructions have already been provided in the labs, the lab steps will now provide more concise instructions. If you need the detailed instructions, you can refer back to other tasks*.

1. Select the **DimProduct** query.

    ![Picture 5643](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image20.png)

32. Rename the query to **Product**.

33. Locate the **FinishedGoodsFlag** column, and then filter the column to retrieve products that are finished goods (i.e. TRUE).

34. Remove all columns, except the following:

    * ProductKey

    * EnglishProductName

    * StandardCost

    * Color

    * DimProductSubcategory

35. Notice that the **DimProductSubcategory** column represents a related table (it contains **Value** links).

36. In the **DimProductSubcategory** column header, at the right of the column name, click the expand button.

    ![Picture 5644](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image21.png)

37. To uncheck all columns, uncheck the **(Select All Columns)** item.

38. Check the **EnglishProductSubcategoryName** and **DimProductCategory** columns.

    ![Picture 5646](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image22.png)

    *By selecting these two columns, a transformation will be applied to join to the **DimProductSubcategory** table, and then include these columns. The **DimProductCategory** column is, in fact, another related table*.

39. Uncheck the **Use Original Column Name as Prefix** checkbox.

    ![Picture 5647](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image23.png)

    *Query column names must always be unique. When checked, this checkbox would prefix each column with the expanded column name (in this case **DimProductSubcategory**). Because it’s known that the selected columns don’t collide with columns in the **Product** query, the option is deselected*.

40. Click **OK**.

    ![Picture 5648](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image24.png)

41. Notice that the transformation resulted in two columns, and that the **DimProductCategory** column has been removed.

42. Expand the **DimProductCategory**, and then introduce only the **EnglishProductCategoryName** column.

    * TotalProductCost

    * SalesAmount

    * DimProduct

    *Recall in **Lab 02A** that a small percentage of **FactResellerSales** rows had missing **TotalProductCost** values. The **DimProduct** column has been included to retrieve the product standard cost, to fix the missing values*.

64. Expand the **DimProduct** column, and then include the **StandardCost** column.

65. To create a custom column, on the **Add Column** ribbon tab, from inside the **General** group, click **Custom Column**.

    ![Picture 5664](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image37.png)

66. In the **Custom Column** window, in the **New Column Name** box, replace the text with **Cost**.

    ![Picture 5665](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image38.png)

67. In the **Custom Column Formula** box, enter the following expression (after the equals symbol):

68. For your convenience, you can copy the expression from the **D:\DA100\Lab03A\Assets\Snippets.txt** file.

    **Power Query**

    ```
    if [TotalProductCost] = null then [OrderQuantity] * [StandardCost] else [TotalProductCost]
    ```

    *This expression tests if the **TotalProductCost** value is missing. If it is, produces a value by multiplying the **OrderQuantity** value by the **StandardCost** value; otherwise, it uses the existing **TotalProductCost** value*.

69. Click **OK**.

    ![Picture 5666](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image39.png)

70. Remove the following two columns:

    * TotalProductCost

    * **SalesAmount** to **Sales**

72. To modify the column data type, in the **Quantity** column header, at the left of the column name, click the **1.2** icon, and then select **Whole Number**.

    ![Picture 5667](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image40.png)

    *Configuring the correct data type is important. When the column contains numeric value, it’s also important to choose the correct type if you expect to perform mathematic calculations*.

73. Modify the following three column data types to **Fixed Decimal Number**.

    * Unit Price

    * Sales

    * Cost

    ![Picture 5668](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image41.png)

    *The fixed decimal number data type stores values with full precision, and so requires more storage space that decimal number. It’s important to use the fixed decimal number type for financial values, or rates (like exchange rates)*.

74. In the status bar, verify that the query has 10 columns and 999+ rows.

    ![Picture 5669](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image42.png)

    *A maximum of 1000 rows will be loaded as preview data for each query*.

    ![Picture 5674](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image45.png)

79. Notice that the column names now appear in the **Attribute** column, and the values appear in the **Value** column.

80. Apply a filter to the **Value** column to remove hyphen (-) values.

81. Rename the following two columns:

    * **Attribute** to **MonthNumber** (no space between the two words—it will be removed later)

    * **Value** to **Target**

    *You will now apply transformations to produce a date column. The date will be derived from the **Year** and **MonthNumber** columns. You will create the column by using the **Columns From Examples** feature*.

82. To prepare the **MonthNumber** column values, right-click the **MonthNumber** column header, and then select **Replace Values**.

    ![Picture 5676](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image46.png)

83. In the **Replace Values** window, in the **Value To Find** box, enter **M**.

    ![Picture 5677](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image47.png)

84. Click **OK**.

    ![Picture 5675](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image49.png)

87. Notice that the first row is for year **2017** and month number **7**.

88. In the **Column1** column, in the first grid cell, commence enter **7/1/2017**, and then press **Enter**.

    *The virtual machine uses US regional settings, so this date is in fact July 1, 2017*.

89. Notice that the grid cells update with predicted values.

    The feature has accurately predicted that you are combining values from two columns.

90. Notice also the formula presented above the query grid.

    ![Picture 5679](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image50.png)

91. To rename the new column, double-click the **Merged** column header.

92. Rename the column as **TargetMonth**.

    ![Picture 5680](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image51.png)

1. In the **Merge** window, in the **Product** query grid, select the **Color** column header.  
	![Picture 5655](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image62.png)

1. Beneath the **Product** query grid, in the dropdown list, select the **ColorFormats** query.

1. In the **ColorFormats** query grid, select the **Color** column header.

1. When the **Privacy Levels** window opens, for each of the two data sources, in the corresponding dropdown list, select **Organizational**.  
	![Picture 5691](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image63.png)  
	*Privacy levels can be configured for data source to determine whether data can be shared between sources. Setting each data source as **Organizational** allows them to share data, if necessary. Note that Private data sources can never be shared with other data sources. It doesn’t mean that Private data cannot be shared; it means that the Power Query engine cannot share data between the sources*.

1. Click **Save**.  
	![Picture 5692](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab03A_image64.png)

1. In the **Merge** window, click **OK**.
