### Lab 09A

Designing a Report in Power BI Desktop, Part 2

# Overview

**The estimated time to complete the lab is 45 minutes**

In this lab, you will enhance the **Sales Report** with advanced design features.

In this lab, you learn how to:

* Sync slicers

* Create a drillthrough page

* Apply conditional formatting

* Create and use bookmarks

# Exercise 1: Configure Sync Slicers

In this exercise, you will sync the report page slicers.

### Task 1: Sync slicers

In this task, you will sync the **Year** and **Region** slicers.

*You will continue the development of the report that you commenced designing in **Lab 08A***.

1. In Power BI Desktop, in the **Sales Report** file, on the **Overview** page, set the **Year** slicer to **FY2018**.

2. Go to the **My Performance** page, and then notice that the **Year** slicer is a different value.

	*When slicers aren’t synced, it can contribute to misrepresentation of data and frustration for report users. You’ll now sync the report slicers*.

3. Go to the **Overview** page, and then select the **Year** slicer.

4. On the **View** ribbon tab, from inside the **Show Panes** group, click **Sync Slicers**.

![Picture 69](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab09A_image5.png)

### Task 1: Create a drill through page

In this task, you will create a new page and configure it as a drill through page.

1. Add a new report page named **Product Details**.

	![Picture 95](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab09A_image6.png)

11. Right-click the **Product Details** page tab, and then select **Hide Page**.

	![Picture 97](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab09A_image7.png)

	*Report users won’t be able to go to the drill through page directly. They’ll need to access it from visuals on other pages. You’ll learn how to drill through to the page in the final exercise of this lab*.

12. Beneath the **Visualizations** pane, in the **Drill Through** section, add the **Product | Category** field to the **Add Drill-Through Fields Here** box.

	![Picture 96](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab09A_image8.png)

13. To test the drill through page, in the drill through filter card, select **Bikes**.

	![Picture 99](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab09A_image9.png)

14. At the top-left of the report page, notice the arrow button.

	![Picture 100](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab09A_image10.png)

	*The button was added automatically. It allows report users to navigate back to the page from which they drilled through*.

15. Add a **Card** visual to the page, and then resize and reposition it so it sits to the right of the button and fills the remaining width of the page.

	![Picture 102](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab09A_image11.png)

	![Picture 101](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab09A_image12.png)

16. Drag the **Product | Category** field into the card visual.

17. Configure the format options for the visual, and then turn the **Category Label** property to **Off**.

	![Picture 103](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab09A_image13.png)

18. Set the **Background Color** property to a light shade of gray.

19. Add a **Table** visual to the page, and then resize and reposition it so it sits beneath the card visual and fills the remaining space on the page.

	![Picture 104](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab09A_image14.png)

	![Picture 105](Linked_image_Files/PowerBI_Lab09A_image15.png)

20. Add the following fields to the visual:

	* Product | Subcategory

	* Product | Color

	* Sales | Quantity

	* Sales | Sales

	* Sales | Profit Margin

21. Configure the format options for the visual, and in the **Grid** section, set the **Text Size** property to **20pt**.

	*The design of the drill through page is almost complete. In the next exercise, you’ll define conditional formatting*.

# Exercise 3: Add Conditional Formatting

In this exercise, you will enhance the drill through page with conditional formatting. When you’ve completed the design, the page will look like the following:
